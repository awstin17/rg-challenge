## Project setup / viewing on local machine

1) `git clone https://github.com/awstin17/rg-challenge.git` in the repository of your choice.

2) cd into the new directory.

3) type `npm install` into your terminal to install dependencies.

4) Then type `npm run serve` to serve the project on localhost. It's the standard Vue CLI server configuration. Pretty simple!

Alternatively, just check out https://rg-challenge.netlify.com/ for an already deployed version. Enjoy!
